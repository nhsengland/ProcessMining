#### Overview
Process Mining is the term given to a family of techniques that have been developed to analyse these records events and process flows, Van Der Aalst et al (2012). 
Process Mining has three main application areas, these are discovery, conformance checking and enhancement. In process discovery, the output is a fact-based process model based on the recorded events in the database. Discovery is the most common process mining investigation, where the discovered process model is often not expected by the supervisor of the process. In conformance checking we measure how well the recorded processes fit a pre-defined process model. Conformance-checking techniques can therefore be used to check whether certain rules and policies are being abided by within an organisation. Finally, enhancement is focused on improving the existing process models by analysing how additional attributes affect the throughput times and frequencies of activities in the process. 

All process mining techniques require an event log to start. An event log is a sequential recording of the events or activites that happened to a particular case (the person or object travelling through the process) with the associated time stamps of the events. Additional attributes for cases or individual events such as the resource responsible for performing the activity on the case allow additional analysis of the effect the attributes have on the process but are not essential to start process mining. The East Midlands Ambulance Service data that was worked with in this repo, was transformed from the reported dataset into an event log, for use with the process mining techinques. In this repo, we've created a fake dataset that resembles the setup of Ambulance service data. This can be created using the fake data generator workbook, and transformed into an event log using the event log workbook. 

With all these requirements and concerns in mind, a few methodologies have been created to aid the adoption and use of process mining within organisations. The most well-known are the L* and PM2 methodologies Aalst (2011), Van Eck et al (2015). Both methodologies describe a similar approach to conducting a process mining project. 


#### Walkthrough 

The project began with East Midlands Ambulance Service stakeholders keen to explore what process mining could do with their data. 
Could it shine a light on their processes, could it inform hidden parts of their processes, could it identify bottlenecks, and could it help drive effiencidie

_**Note:** Only public or fake data are shared in this repository._

### Project Stucture

- The main code is found in the root of the repository (see Usage below for more information)
- The accompanying [report](./reports/report.pdf) is also available in the `reports` folder
- More information about the code usage can be found in the [model card](./model_card.md)
- {OTHER REPO STRUCTURE}
- 
This repository holds code for the Process Mining with EMAS project. 
This project was undertaken in collaboration with East Midlands Ambulance Service Data, and built within their IG area using their data. 
The data within this repo is fake data, generated from the fake data generator workbook. It resembles EMAS data in form, but is completely fake.
